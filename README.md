## How I Made This    
I built this project with HTML5 and CSS with UIkit. The purpose of the project was initially to practice using UIkit, a library I had never used before. As I got more into the project, the educational value of it became more apparent, and rather than make a silly webpage that didn't really say anything, I turned it into more of an actual educational effort.

## Future Development Ideas     
--I would like to add more user interaction--perhaps users could sign a guest book when they visit, or they could fill out a contact form for a lemur newsletter.
